As the projects that we package and distribute grow, conventionally so do the use cases along with large communities of power users. As it has become very difficult for us to support Swiss Army Knife style images we are looking to the community of users to start customizing our base image layer themselves.</p> <p>Something we provide and pride ourselves on is keeping our containers up to date with not only the latest external software releases, but also with the latest distribution level packages. Conventionally when people needed some form of custom functionality they would fork our source and build something once that suited their needs leaving this dangling fork without updates or basic maintenance.</p> <p>Behind the scenes we have been working to provide the community with the ability to customize our images not only for themselves but also for other users. This comes in the form of 3 different tools:</p> <ul> <li>Private Custom Scripts: Run once when the container is started before services (including the main service/app) are started</li> <li>Private Custom Services: Run at the same time as other services. Service get restarted on exit</li> <li>Public Facing Docker Mods: Provide extensions to the containers filesystem. Scripts/services can be implemented as s6 services</li> </ul> <p>All of the functionality described in this post is live on every one of the containers we currently maintain:</p> <p>https://fleet.linuxserver.io</p> <p>NOTE: While the following support has been added to our containers, we will not give support to any custom scripts, services, or mods.

In every container, simply create a new folder located at <code>/custom-cont-init.d</code> and add any scripts you want. These scripts can contain logic for installing packages, copying over custom files to other locations, or installing plugins.</p> <p>Because this location is outside of <code>/config</code> you will need to mount it like any other volume if you wish to make use of it. e.g. <code>-v /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-files:/custom-cont-init.d</code> if using the Docker CLI or</p> <pre><code>services:\nbar:\nvolumes:\n- /home/foo/appdata/bar:/config\n- /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-files:/custom-cont-init.d:ro\n</code></pre> <p>if using compose. Where possible, to improve security, we recommend mounting them read-only (<code>:ro</code>) so that container processes cannot write to the location.</p> <p>One example use case is our Piwigo container has a plugin that supports video, but requires ffmpeg to be installed. No problem. Add this bad boy into a script file (can be named anything) and you're good to go.</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"**** installing ffmpeg ****\"\napk add --no-cache ffmpeg\n</code></pre> <p>NOTE: The folder <code>/custom-cont-init.d</code> needs to be owned by root!

Similarly to the custom scripts, just create a new directory at <code>/custom-services.d</code>. The files in this directory should be named after the service they will be running. Similar to with custom scripts you will need to mount this folder like any other volume if you wish to make use of it. e.g. <code>-v /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-services:/custom-services.d</code> if using the Docker CLI or</p> <pre><code>services:\nbar:\nvolumes:\n- /home/foo/appdata/bar:/config\n- /home/foo/appdata/my-custom-services:/custom-services.d:ro\n</code></pre> <p>if using compose.

Drop this script in <code>/custom-services.d/cron</code> and it will run automatically in the container:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/with-contenv bash\n\n/usr/sbin/crond -f -S -l 0 -c /etc/crontabs\n</code></pre> <p>NOTE: With this example, you will most likely need to have cron installed via a custom script using the technique in the previous section, and will need to populate the crontab.</p> <p>NOTE: The folder <code>/custom-services.d</code> needs to be owned by root!

Normally, we could just put in the directive <code>proxy_pass https://heimdall:443;</code> and expect nginx to connect to Heimdall via its container name used as a dns hostname. Although it works for the most part, nginx has an annoying habit. During start, nginx checks all dns hostnames used in proxy_pass statements and if any one of them is not accessible, it refuses to start. We really don't want a stopped proxied container to prevent our webserver from starting up, so we use a trick.</p> <p>If the proxy_pass statement contains a <code>variable</code> instead of a <code>dns hostname</code>, nginx doesn't check whether it's accessible or not during start. So here we are setting 3 variables, one named <code>upstream_app</code> with the value of <code>heimdall</code>, one named <code>$upstream_port</code>, with the value of the internal heimdall port <code>443</code>, and one named <code>$upstream_proto</code> with the value set to <code>https</code>. We we use these variables as the address in the proxy_pass directive. That way, if the heimdall container is down for any reason, nginx can still start. When using a variable instead of hostname, we also have to set the resolver to docker dns in the previous line.</p> <p>If the proxied container is not in the same user defined bridge network as SWAG (could be on a remote host, could be using host networking or macvlan), we can change the value of <code>$upstream_app</code> to an IP address instead: <code>set $upstream_app 192.168.1.10;</code></p>"},{"location":"general/swag/#subfolder-proxy-conf","title":"Subfolder proxy conf","text":"<p>Here's the preset proxy conf for mytinytodo via a subfolder</p> <pre><code># works with https://github.com/breakall/mytinytodo-docker\n# set the mtt_url to 'https://your.domain.com/todo/' in db/config.php\n\nlocation /todo {\nreturn 301 $scheme://$host/todo/;\n}\nlocation ^~ /todo/ {\n\n# enable the next two lines for http auth\n#auth_basic \"Restricted\";\n#auth_basic_user_file /config/nginx/.htpasswd;\n\n# enable the next two lines for ldap auth, also customize and enable ldap.conf in the default conf\n#auth_request /auth;\n#error_page 401 =200 /ldaplogin;\n\n# enable for Authelia, also enable authelia-server.conf in the default site config\n#include /config/nginx/authelia-location.conf;\n\ninclude /config/nginx/proxy.conf;\nresolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s;\nset $upstream_app mytinytodo;\nset $upstream_port 80;\nset $upstream_proto http;\nproxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port/;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Unlike the subdomain proxy confs, here we do not have a server block.

Keep in mind that the port listed here is the container port because nginx is connecting to this container directly via the docker network. So if our mytinytodo container has a port mapping of <code>-p 8080:80</code>, we still set <code>$upstream_port</code> variable to <code>80</code>.</p> <p>Nginx has an interesting behavior displayed here. Even though we define <code>http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/</code> as the address nginx should proxy, nginx actually connects to <code>http://$upstream_mytinytodo:80/todo</code>. Whenever we use a variable as part of the proxy_pass url, nginx automatically appends the defined <code>location</code> (in this case <code>/todo</code>) to the end of the proxy_pass url before it connects.

From there add roms to the respective <code>roms</code> directories and follow the on screen instructions to add them to your web frontend running on port 80.</p> <p>The frontend application has been initially optimized around being used with a standard gamepad (more specifically for modern Xbox consoles that have chromium based Edge browsers). The navigation revolves around the up/down/left/right keys to browse the menus and launch games. Mobile browsers will function, just keep in mind compatibility will be reduced especially for CD based games.</p> <p>It is important to note that some of the current emulators used for this frontend are obfuscated code, efforts are being made to reverse engineer it but you should know it can potentially reach out to third party services if you manually enable features like netplay (this should never happen in a stock setup). The point of this message is that on top of the de-obfuscation effort there is also effort to stop using binary blobs and shift to built from source libretro emscripten blobs, for now this web based emulation stack is the best for useability and compatibility. We are in the process to transitioning to libretro cores for emulators, currently 27/30 emulators have been replaced.</p> <p>For Xbox users please click the select button a couple times after launching a game to ensure the B button does not trigger a \"back\" action in the browser. (official name \"view button\" it is the two small squares) Exiting the controller mode and back to browser controls can be triggered by holding the start button for 3 seconds. (official name \"menu button\" the three lines) You will be unable to use features like save states and modify controller layouts on the emulatorjs based emulators currently as I have not determined a methodology of re-entering controller mode once you exit it. All normal game saves will function given you exit the game play screen cleanly using the B button for back this includes multi disc games for psx. Your game saves are stored in browser storage by hostname so if you make any changes to your local hosted setup (port or IP) the saves will not follow with it. For libretro based emulators you can use the button combination start+select+L+R to access the libretro menu and change settings/save or load/etc.</p> <p>We know about most of the oddities like crackling sound for some emulators, rendering issues, and games unreliably auto launching to fullscreen. In general full CD games on the Xbox web browser do not seem to work due to their size if you have a chd/pbp less than 450 megs it will run. Edge on Xbox has some kind of undocumented ram limitation of about a gigabyte. Until all emulators are transitioned to libretro cores the oddities of using self hosted EmulatorJS will not be something that can or should be solved using hacky workarounds interacting with obfuscated code. Just keep in mind these are full blown machine emulators running in Javascript in a browser, do not expect bare metal performance.</p> <p>Mounting in existing rom directories can be achieved by pointing to the default folder structure, IE lets say you would like to mount your NES library:</p> <p><code>-v /path/to/nes/roms:/data/nes/roms</code></p> <p>The folder names are: * 3do * arcade * atari2600 * atari7800 * colecovision * doom * gb * gba * gbc * jaguar * lynx * msx * n64 * nds * nes * ngp * odyssey2 * pce * psx * sega32x * segaCD * segaGG * segaMD * segaMS * segaSaturn * segaSG * snes * vb * vectrex * ws</p>"},{"location":"images/docker-emulatorjs/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.</p>"},{"location":"images/docker-emulatorjs/#docker-compose-recommended-click-here-for-more-info","title":"docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info)","text":"<pre><code>---\nversion: \"2.1\"\nservices:\nemulatorjs:\nimage: lscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs:latest\ncontainer_name: emulatorjs\nenvironment:\n- PUID=1000\n- PGID=1000\n- TZ=Etc/UTC\n- SUBFOLDER=/ #optional\nvolumes:\n- /path/to/config:/config\n- /path/to/data:/data\nports:\n- 3000:3000\n- 80:80\n- 4001:4001 #optional\nrestart: unless-stopped\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"images/docker-emulatorjs/#docker-cli-click-here-for-more-info","title":"docker cli (click here for more info)","text":"<pre><code>docker run -d \\\n--name=emulatorjs \\\n-e PUID=1000 \\\n-e PGID=1000 \\\n-e TZ=Etc/UTC \\\n-e SUBFOLDER=/ `#optional` \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n-p 80:80 \\\n-p 4001:4001 `#optional` \\\n-v /path/to/config:/config \\\n-v /path/to/data:/data \\\n--restart unless-stopped \\\nlscr.io/linuxserver/emulatorjs:latest\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"images/docker-emulatorjs/#parameters","title":"Parameters","text":"<p>Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

We make pre-defined bots we use in our workflow, but you have to have an underlying understanding of javascript and some basic Docker skills to use it.</p> <p>The entire basis of this is to act as middleware between your email address receiving orders from https://checkout.linuxserver.io and send them to some external service. The bot will archive any messages that do not come from orders@nanocheckout.com with valid DKIM signatures, so definetly do not use this on a personal account.</p> <p>The concept behind this bot and using email as a destination for orders is to serve normal users that simply want an email for an order out of the box and provide a free messaging queue akin to something like RabbitMQ for people that want to automate order ingestion. </p> <p>By default we include bots we use that will be copied over on first container run, for example a simple discord ping when an order is received with the order details: <pre><code>const Discord = require('discord.js');\nconst YAML = require('yaml');\nconst discordtoken = process.env.DISCORD_TOKEN;\nconst roomid = process.env.DISCORD_ROOM\n\n\nexports.orderbot = async function(order) {\n  return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {\n    const client = new Discord.Client();\n    client.login(discordtoken);\n    client.on('ready', async () =&gt; {\n      delete order.rawpayload\n      await client.channels.cache.get(roomid.toString()).send(YAML.stringify(order));\n      client.destroy();\n      resolve(true)\n    })\n  });\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>This code will be passed an order object containing all the order details parsed from the email message. Here we use custom env variables to set application settings to connect up to and send a message to discord. </p> <p>In order to use this bot you will need to perform the following setup steps:  1. Create a dedicated gmail account to use for https://checkout.linuxserver.io 2. Enable API access to this Gmail account by clicking on <code>Enable the Gmail API</code> here https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/nodejs 3. Save your credentials.json file from that action to the folder you will be bind mounting as <code>/config</code> 4. Run <code>docker run --rm -it -u $(id -u ${USER}):$(id -g ${USER}) -v /path/to/data:/config --entrypoint /config.sh lsiodev/gmail-order-bot</code> 5. Go to the URL prompted and enter the key you get from it. 6. Start the container using the run/compose example in this readme.</p> <p>When the container starts if you are using a custom bot located in <code>/config/bots</code> it will install the node modules included in it's package.json, do not use system level node modules this container is Alpine based and it will cause conflicts. </p> <p>From there the bot will loop in for your defined timeout and pull in emails and spit out orders to your destination.</p>"},{"location":"images/docker-gmail-order-bot/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<p>To help you get started creating a container from this image you can either use docker-compose or the docker cli.</p>"},{"location":"images/docker-gmail-order-bot/#docker-compose-recommended-click-here-for-more-info","title":"docker-compose (recommended, click here for more info)","text":"<pre><code>---\nversion: \"2.1\"\nservices:\ngmail-order-bot:\nimage: lscr.io/lsiodev/gmail-order-bot:latest\ncontainer_name: gmail-order-bot\nenvironment:\n- PUID=1000\n- PGID=1000\n- BOT_NAME=discord\n- LOOP_TIME=60\nvolumes:\n- /path/to/data:/config\nrestart: unless-stopped\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"images/docker-gmail-order-bot/#docker-cli-click-here-for-more-info","title":"docker cli (click here for more info)","text":"<pre><code>docker run -d \\\n--name=gmail-order-bot \\\n-e PUID=1000 \\\n-e PGID=1000 \\\n-e BOT_NAME=discord \\\n-e LOOP_TIME=60 \\\n-v /path/to/data:/config \\\n--restart unless-stopped \\\nlscr.io/lsiodev/gmail-order-bot:latest\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"images/docker-gmail-order-bot/#parameters","title":"Parameters","text":"<p>Docker images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above).

Then create a new network in the Networks tab and set the correct pre-defined muxes and orbital position. Go back to the TV adapters tab and add the newly created network under universal LNB. Go back to the Networks tab and mark the network you created earlier and press the Force Scan button. Tvheadend will now scan the muxes for services.</p> <p>After the scan is done, head to the Services tab and find the services you want as channels, mark them, and press map services. They should now appear under Configuration --&gt; Channel/EPG.</p> <p>Latest</p> <p>The first thing to do is to run the setup wizard.

If it's listed, you will have to configure the grabber before enabling. Find the path in the path field of your grabber. We will use the last part. It starts with tv_grab_. Add it after /usr/bin/ in the below command. There should be no space between Usr/bin/ and the part you added.</p> <pre><code>docker exec -it -u abc tvheadend /usr/bin/for_you_to_fill_out --configure\n</code></pre> <p>Now follow the onscreen progress. If you get asked about cache, just accept the default. After you have configured your grabber, you can go back and enable your grabber.</p> <p>If you allready have a configuration file, you can add it in the .xmltv folder where you mapped the /config volume. If it's not created, create it.</p> <p>Comskip This container comes with Comskip for commercial flagging of recordings. This you have to add in the recording config of tvheadend. Go to Configuration --&gt; Recording. Change the view level to advanced in the top right corner, and add the below in the Post-processor command field.</p> <pre><code>/usr/bin/comskip --ini=/config/comskip/comskip.ini \"%f\"\n</code></pre> <p>Now comskip will run after each recording is finished. You will find comskip.ini in the comskip folder of your /config volume mapping. See the Comskip homepage for tuning of the ini file.</p> <p>FFmpeg</p> <p>FFmpeg is installed in /usr/bin/ in case you need to use it with pipe.</p> <p>EPG XML file</p> <p>If you have EPG data in XML format from a supplier, you can drop it in the data folder of your /config volume mapping. If it doesn't exist, create it. Then choose the XML file grabber in Configuration --&gt; Channel/EPG --&gt; EPG Grabber Modules. If you use WebGrab+Plus, choose the WebGrab+Plus XML file grabber. The XML file goes in the same path as above. The xml file has to be named guide.xml.</p> <p>For advanced setup of tvheadend, go to [Tvheadend][appurl]</p> <p>Picons</p> <p>We have added all the picons from picons in the folder /picons. To enable the use of these picons, add the path to the Channel icon path in Configuration --&gt; General --&gt; Base.

Kernels newer than 5.6 generally have the wireguard module built-in (along with some older custom kernels). However, the module may not be enabled. Make sure it is enabled prior to starting the container.</p> <p>If the kernel is not built-in, or installed on host, the container will check if the kernel headers are present (in <code>/usr/src</code>) and if not, it will attempt to download the necessary kernel headers from the <code>ubuntu xenial/bionic</code>, <code>debian/raspbian buster</code> repos; then will attempt to compile and install the kernel module. If the kernel headers are not found in either <code>usr/src</code> or in the repos mentioned, container will sleep indefinitely as wireguard cannot be installed.</p> <p>If you're on a debian/ubuntu based host with a custom or downstream distro provided kernel (ie. Pop!_OS), the container won't be able to install the kernel headers from the regular ubuntu and debian repos. In those cases, you can try installing the headers on the host via <code>sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)</code> (if distro version) and then add a volume mapping for <code>/usr/src:/usr/src</code>, or if custom built, map the location of the existing headers to allow the container to use host installed headers to build the kernel module (tested successful on Pop!_OS, ymmv).</p> <p>With regards to arm32/64 devices, Raspberry Pi 2-4 running the official ubuntu images or Raspbian Buster are supported out of the box. For all other devices and OSes, you can try installing the kernel headers on the host, and mapping <code>/usr/src:/usr/src</code> and it may just work (no guarantees).</p> <p>This can be run as a server or a client, based on the parameters used.</p>"},{"location":"images/docker-wireguard/#server-mode","title":"Server Mode","text":"<p>If the environment variable <code>PEERS</code> is set to a number or a list of strings separated by comma, the container will run in server mode and the necessary server and peer/client confs will be generated.
